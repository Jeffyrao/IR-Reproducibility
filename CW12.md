# ClueWeb12 B13 Comparisons
What follows is an initial comparison of selected information retrieval systems on the ClueWeb12 B13 collection using scripts provided by authors/leading contributors of those systems. The systems are listed in alphabetical order.

## Indexing
Two metrics for indexing are reported below: the size of the generated index, and the time taken to generate that index.

System  | Type              |    Size |                  Time | Terms | Postings | Tokens |
:-------|:------------------|--------:|----------------------:|------:|---------:|--------:
ATIRE   | Count             | 42.4 GB |                3h 03m |       |          |        |
ATIRE   | Count + Quantized | 53.4 GB |                4h 25m |       |          |        |
JASS    |                   | 83.2 GB | ATIRE Quantized + 32m |       |          |        |
MG4J    | Count             |   17 GB |                2h 38m |  133M |    12.7G |        |
MG4J    | Position          |   58 GB |                3h 20m |  133M |    12.7G |  33.8G |

###### ATIRE
+ The quantized index pre-calculates the BM25 scores at indexing time and stores these instead of term frequencies, more about the quantization in ATIRE can be found in [Crane et al. (2013)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2507860).
  + The quantization is performed single threaded although easily parallelized.
+ Both indexes were not stemmed.
+ Both indexes were pruned of SGML tags, used for typically unused search time features.
+ Both indexes postings lists are stored impact ordered, with docids being compressed using variable-byte compression after being delta encoded.

## Retrieval
Both retrieval efficiency (by query latency) and effectiveness (MAP@1000) were measured on two query sets: 201-250, and 251-300.

### Retrieval Models

###### ATIRE
+ ATIRE uses a modified version of BM25, described [here](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/homepages/andrew/papers/2012-1.pdf).
+ Searching was done using top-k search also described in the above paper.
  + This is not early termination, all documents for all terms in the query still get scored.
+ BM25 parameters were set to the default for ATIRE, `k1=0.9 b=0.4`.
+ Only stopping of tags was performed, this has no effect on search.

###### MG4J

See the description for the [Gov2 runs](Gov2.md).

### Retrieval Latency
The table below shows the average search time across queries by query set. The search times were taken from the internal reporting of each systems.

System  | Model          | Index             | Topics 201-250 | Topics 251-300
:-------|:---------------|-------------------|---------------:|--------------:
ATIRE   | BM25           | Count             |          809ms |          788ms
ATIRE   | Quantized BM25 | Count + Quantized |          290ms |          296ms
JASS    |                |                   |          222ms |          261ms
JASS    | 5M Postings    |                   |          103ms |           88ms
MG4J    | BM25           | Count             |          706ms |          570ms
MG4J    | Model B        | Count             |           60ms |           73ms
MG4J    | Model B+       | Position          |          122ms |          258ms

### Retrieval Effectiveness
The systems generated run files to be consumed by the `trec_eval` tool. Each system was evaluated on the top 1000 results for each query, and the table below shows the MAP scores for the systems.

System  | Model          | Index             | Topics 201-250 | Topics 251-300

##### Statistical Analysis

**TODO:** Need to run statistical analyses.
